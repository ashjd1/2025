Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

A VPC is a virtual network that you create in the cloud. It allows you to have your own private section of the internet,
just like having your own network within a larger network. Within this VPC, you can create and manage various resources,
such as servers, databases, and storage.

Think of it as having your own little "internet" within the bigger internet. This virtual network is completely isolated from
other users' networks, so your data and applications are secure and protected.

To connect your VPC to the internet or other networks, you can set up gateways or routers. 
These act as entry and exit points for traffic going in and out of your VPC. You can control the flow of traffic and set 
up security measures to protect your resources from unauthorized access.

With a VPC, you have control over your network environment. You can define access rules, set up firewalls,
and configure security groups to regulate who can access your resources and how they can communicate.

user -> internet gateway -> public subnet -> NACL -> load balancer -> route tables -> security groups

NACL (Network Access Control List)

when you are creating VPS, AWS will crate internet gateway, NACL and route table by default

steps for VPC 

create VPC => VPC and more => create EC2 => change SG in EC2 to access from outside.
			 (This option will create the all
			 required thing like subnet, route table
			 and internate gateway)
